 *
 *  Description:
 *  ============
 *
 *  Utilities for loop and dep-graph code.
 *
 *  Interface:
 *
 *	void CGPREP_Init_Op(OP *op)
 *	  Initialize CGPREP data structures for newly-created <op>.
 *
 *	INT16 CGPREP_Same_Res_Opnd(OP *op)
 *	  Requires: OPER_same_res(Operator(OP_code(op))) 
 *		    (currently means <op> is select or unaligned ld)
 *	  Return the operand number for the operand of <op> that can
 *	  be the same as the result, or -1 if no operand qualifies.
 *
 *	TN *CGPREP_Dup_TN(TN *old_tn)
 *	  Return a TN equivalent to <old_tn>, except that it has a new
 *	  TN_number.  This works even for dedicated TNs, and differs from
 *	  Dup_TN_Even_If_Dedicated because it doesn't reset the flag
 *	  for TN_is_dedicated or the register assignment for dedicated TNs.
 *
 *	void CGPREP_Copy_TN(TN *dest, TN *src, OP *point, UINT8 omega,
 *			    BOOL before)
 *	  Insert a copy from <src>[<omega>] to <dest>, either just
 *	  before <point> if <before> is TRUE, or just after <point>
 *	  otherwise.
 *
 *	void CGPREP_Copy_TN_Into_BB(TN *dest, TN *src, BB *bb, OP *point,
 *				    UINT8 omega, BOOL before)
 *	  Insert a copy from <src>[<omega>] to <dest>.
 *        Arguments are the same as in CGPREP_Copy_TN with the addition of 
 *        BB *bb. This can be used in cases where there may be no OPs
 *        in the BB yet.
