//   SWP_Bundle: This function will bundle the ops in the op_state,
//   denoting each SWP_OP with a slot number offset from the beginning
//   of the loop body.  Each OP will be marked as OP_end_group() and
//   OP_m_unit as appropriate, and every op will be marked as OP_bundled.
//   New noops will be inserted where necessary to provide legal bundling.
//
//   The noops are inserted at the end of the op_state, and we assume
//   the ops will be sorted on slot position by the emitter to put them
//   in the final bundled order.
