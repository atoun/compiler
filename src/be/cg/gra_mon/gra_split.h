//  Live range splitting
/////////////////////////////////////
//  
//  Description:
//
//      When the coloring process comes to a live range that it cannot color,
//      it tries to split it into a higher priority part that it can color and
//      a bunch of other stuff that is not guaranteed to be colorable.  The
//      second part may be split again when it is considered for coloring.
//      The second part must be placed in the correct position on the coloring
//      list so that it will be considered before any Briggs points of lower
//      priority that intefere with it.
//
//  Exported function:
//
//      BOOL LRANGE_Split( LRANGE* lrange, LRANGE_CLIST_ITER* iter,
//                                         LRANGE**           alloc_lrange )
//          If possible, split <lrange> into a colorable part and a deferred
//          part.  Return TRUE to indicate success, with the new colorable
//          LRANGE returned by reference in <alloc_lrange>.
//
//          In fact, only one new LRANGE is created, the one returned by
//          reference in <alloc_lrange> which is guaranteed to have an
//          avialable register before any further allocations.  The original
//          <lrange> is modified to reflect the split and added back into the
//          coloring list at the appropriate point.  <iter> is the coloring
//          list iterator, <lrange> must be the _Current element of <iter>.
