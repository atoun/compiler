 * Revision history:
 *  11-Apr-96 - Original Version
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * External definitions for the -TARG group.
 *
 * Some of these variables are also defined in config.h or
 * MIPS/config_targ.h, for historical reasons.  In order to separate
 * the headers and minimize dependencies on changes to this one, new
 * group members should be defined only here, and their users should
 * explicitly include this file instead of having it indirectly
 * included (e.g. via config.h or MIPS/config_targ.h).  We should also
 * work towards removing most of the definitions from those headers.
 *
 * Exported variables should have names prefixed by "TARG_" to
 * facilitate moving them to a pushable struct later if desired.
 * See config_debug.[hc] for an example.
